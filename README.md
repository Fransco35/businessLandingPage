SparksLP is a landing page that I built using html, css/scss(node-sass). It is fully responsive on all viewports in web and mobile screens.

The idea behind the building of this project is to create a responsive landing page using vanilla css without any css framework which I achieved upon completion of sparkLP.

For anyone looking to read through the css code a good knowledge of SCSS is required to make it easy for you. I made comments(mostly for the media queries) to make understanding the code easy for those reading through it.
